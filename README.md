# Delimora

Delimora is designed for accountants using Windows, enabling them to easily generate CSV files formatted for DATEV import.

The workflow involves downloading CSV files from a folder in Google Drive. However, these files are not in a format acceptable by DATEV. Delimora will edit the format, making it easy for accountants to import the files into DATEV.
